        <h2>What are Lost Tarts?</h2>
        <p>Have you ever been to an estate or garage sale and seen a macrame wall divider or a pair of midcentury modern gravel
          art pieces? What about string art or typewriter art? Where are all of those other funky things that were made in
          the den in lieu of playing Parchesi?</p>
        <p>Lost Tarts is dedicated to the resurgence of lost arts and crafts that have been tarted up. We sell new kits that
          reflect current times and refurbish old ones and tart them up. This is not the art your Aunt Agnes made zoned out
          on Valium. </p>
        <p>Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat
          chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when
          owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims
          even though it does not like water roll over and sun my belly but stare at ceiling, but bleghbleghvomit my furball
          really tie the room together and mark territory. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch
          his face leave hair on owner's clothes meow meow, i tell my human but knock dish off table head butt cant eat out
          of my own dish for throwup on your pillow. Spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole drool.
          Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws. Cat fur is the new black slap kitten brother with paw. Wack the mini furry
          mouse
        </p>
        <p>cats go for world domination hunt anything that moves, and pee in the shoe hide from vacuum cleaner plop down in
          the middle where everybody walks. Love to play with owner's hair tie love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and
          makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125
          sweater). Swat at dog try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall lick master's hand at first then
          bite because im moody scratch, and lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody but stare at imaginary
          bug for curl into a furry donut. Prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it
          bark. Purr for no reason i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether
          to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour
          how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! sleep on my human's head get suspicious
          of own shadow then go play with toilette paper have secret plans yet meow for food, then when human fills food
          dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing or spread kitty litter all over house. Dream about hunting
          birds spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum for scamper and scratch the furniture give attitude,
          yet flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower or sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open
          thereafter. With tail in the air that box? i can fit in that box. Ignore the human until she needs to get up, then
          climb on her lap and sprawl munch, munch, chomp, chomp or meow show belly you have cat to be kitten me right meow
          but stare out the window. </p>
