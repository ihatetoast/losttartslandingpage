# Product Landing Page

[deployed on Surge](http://ihatetoast-LostTartsLandingPage.surge.sh/)

Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Certification project

A very simple tribute page for the great John Cleese. I completed this several years ago; however, I decided I wanted a copy on GitHub as well as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ihatetoast/full/RRmgYK/).

Colors used to reflect what I imagine a 70s business suit and shirt would look like.

Toolbox:

- HTML5
- CSS (No Sass! Kept it painfully basic)
